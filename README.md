An ethereum contract to manage storj file object challenge salts for automated distributed audtis.

This will require zkSNARK implementation in ethereum. I believe this is not yet possible. See https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/12/05/zksnarks-in-a-nutshell/ for details on what is needed.

Another possible use for etheruem is to register contract metadata as discussed in 2.4 of the Storj whitepaper. The benefit of this is creating a backup of shard locations. The downside is that it is somewhat costly to register data in blockchains.
